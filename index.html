			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781493051038">Fifty Shades of Crimson</a> by Pete Tomsett üìö</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre a fan of King Crimson (or any group KC-adjacent), this is a fantastic book that walks you through the history of Crimson and Robert Fripp.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt stop reading it.</p>
<p>Of course, while listening to the albums as they come up in the story‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I spun up a VM on DigitalOcean, and was able to get it all to work within 15 minutes (with some minor Linux work).</p>

			 <p>Woke up at 450a to order the new iPhone (upgrading from the 14 Pro Max, getting the 15 Pro Max).</p>
<p>Ordered through Verizon (my carrier) because they were offering some really great incentives (including the Watch Ultra 2, which I don&rsquo;t need, but got anyway).</p>
<p>3.5 hours later&hellip;</p>
<p>After some ridiculous issues with Verizon (balance due on an account I had with them years ago), and my bank being stupid (but safe, thankfully), everything was ordered.</p>
<p>This was the first time in several years that I had any issues with pre-ordering. I forgot how horrible the experience was if one little thing goes wrong&hellip;</p>
