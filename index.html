		<a href="https://winnick.is/2023/06/05/initial-thoughts-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-06-05 12:21:23 -0700">Jun 5, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>Here are some of my thoughts on the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>$3499. Yikes. However, I think I can get over that with the rest of my points&hellip;</li>
<li>This is an amazing piece of technology. What they packed in there is just insane.</li>
<li>It essentially eliminated the need for pretty much every tech-driven device in your house.</li>
<li>You no longer need a TV, sound system, or a computer. Obviously, I am writing this <em>right after</em> the Keynote, so I don&rsquo;t know what connectivity looks like, so there could be more on this list.</li>
<li>Looking at it from an enterprise perspective, the $3499 price tag is roughly in the mid-point of what companies spend on new hire equipment and setup. Just give them one of these, and they&rsquo;re set (even for remote work).</li>
<li>All the tech that Apple has been working on for, at least, the past 5-7 years was to get to this product. It&rsquo;s quite remarkable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts as I watch videos from the demo area, and subsequent follow-up videos from my favorite tech peeps.</p>

			 <p>Follow up to my <a href="https://winnick.is/2023/06/02/migrated-all-of.html">post</a> from the other day‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Not a huge fan of <a href="https://www.tutanota.com">Tutanota</a>. There‚Äôs a lot that they do right, but not enough for me.</p>
<p>Moved everything to <a href="https://www.skiff.com">Skiff</a>. I‚Äôve had an account there since they started up, and never really used it.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs see what happens‚Ä¶</p>

			 <p>Migrated all of my e-mail from <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">Fastmail</a> to <a href="https://www.tutanota.com">Tutanota</a> today.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t using too many of the features on Fastmail, so I decided to go with the more secure, cheaper option at Tutanota.</p>
<p>Knowing me, I&rsquo;ll either switch back or move back over to <a href="https://proton.me">Proton</a> in a couple of weeks.</p>
