			 <p>Preseason between the San Jose Sharks and LA Kings (well, the Ontario Reign, the Kings AHL team, playing as the Kings for the preseason).</p>
<p>It was weird seeing hockey in a different arena than Staples Center (I refuse to call it by its new name).</p>
<p>Kings beat the Sharks 2-1 in a great OT period.</p>

			 <p>Woke up at 450a to order the new iPhone (upgrading from the 14 Pro Max, getting the 15 Pro Max).</p>
<p>Ordered through Verizon (my carrier) because they were offering some really great incentives (including the Watch Ultra 2, which I don&rsquo;t need, but got anyway).</p>
<p>3.5 hours later&hellip;</p>
<p>After some ridiculous issues with Verizon (balance due on an account I had with them years ago), and my bank being stupid (but safe, thankfully), everything was ordered.</p>
<p>This was the first time in several years that I had any issues with pre-ordering. I forgot how horrible the experience was if one little thing goes wrong&hellip;</p>
