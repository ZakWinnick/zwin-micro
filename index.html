			 <p>Preseason between the San Jose Sharks and LA Kings (well, the Ontario Reign, the Kings AHL team, playing as the Kings for the preseason).</p>
<p>It was weird seeing hockey in a different arena than Staples Center (I refuse to call it by its new name).</p>
<p>Kings beat the Sharks 2-1 in a great OT period.</p>

			 <p>Woke up at 450a to order the new iPhone (upgrading from the 14 Pro Max, getting the 15 Pro Max).</p>
<p>Ordered through Verizon (my carrier) because they were offering some really great incentives (including the Watch Ultra 2, which I don&rsquo;t need, but got anyway).</p>
<p>3.5 hours later&hellip;</p>
<p>After some ridiculous issues with Verizon (balance due on an account I had with them years ago), and my bank being stupid (but safe, thankfully), everything was ordered.</p>
<p>This was the first time in several years that I had any issues with pre-ordering. I forgot how horrible the experience was if one little thing goes wrong&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Drove out to <a href="https://www.francisfordcoppolawinery.com/">Francis Ford Coppola Winery</a> today. I was really excited, but came out disappointed. I was really expecting more from the &ldquo;museum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, it did allow for a stop in Downtown Healdsburg, where one of my favorite butcher shops in all of CA resides, <a href="https://journeymanmeat.com/">Journeyman Meat Co.</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, they have these awesome paintings in the bathroom&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here are some of my thoughts on the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>$3499. Yikes. However, I think I can get over that with the rest of my points&hellip;</li>
<li>This is an amazing piece of technology. What they packed in there is just insane.</li>
<li>It essentially eliminated the need for pretty much every tech-driven device in your house.</li>
<li>You no longer need a TV, sound system, or a computer. Obviously, I am writing this <em>right after</em> the Keynote, so I don&rsquo;t know what connectivity looks like, so there could be more on this list.</li>
<li>Looking at it from an enterprise perspective, the $3499 price tag is roughly in the mid-point of what companies spend on new hire equipment and setup. Just give them one of these, and they&rsquo;re set (even for remote work).</li>
<li>All the tech that Apple has been working on for, at least, the past 5-7 years was to get to this product. It&rsquo;s quite remarkable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts as I watch videos from the demo area, and subsequent follow-up videos from my favorite tech peeps.</p>
